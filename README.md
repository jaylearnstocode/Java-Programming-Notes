# Java Programming Notes

Welcome to this comprehensive set of notes on **Java programming**, based on the course *Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java* by **Georgia Tech**.

https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/gtx-introduction-to-object-oriented-programming-with-java

These notes are designed for beginners and gradually progress toward more advanced topics. They were originally wrote by me as a personal study guide but have since received nearly **4,000 stars and favorites** on the Chinese social media app 🍠 **Red Notes** ([view this post here](96 COVFEFE转码中发布了一篇小红书笔记，快来看吧！ 😆 uiNbrZ7r63IQf8y 😆 http://xhslink.com/a/84MbO84ePAXbb，复制本条信息，打开【小红书】App查看精彩内容！), becoming a popular resource among those starting their journey in software development.

> 💡 These notes were my introduction to programming and helped build a strong foundation in computer science. I hope they can do the same for you.
