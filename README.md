# Java Programming Notes

Welcome to this comprehensive set of notes on **Java programming**, based on the course *Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java* by **Georgia Tech**.

These notes are designed for beginners and gradually progress toward more advanced topics. They were originally created as a personal study guide but have since received nearly **2,000 stars and favorites**, becoming a popular resource among those starting their journey in software development.

> 💡 These notes were my introduction to programming and helped build a strong foundation in computer science. I hope they can do the same for you.
